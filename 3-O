Best Case: O(n*log n) (The best case occurs when the pivot is always close to the middle, leading to balanced partitions.)
Average Case: O(nlog n) (On average, Quick Sort will have a time complexity of O(nlog n).)
Worst Case: O(n^2) (The worst case occurs when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element, leading to unbalanced partitions.)
