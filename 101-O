Best Case: O(n) (The best case occurs when the list is already sorted, and no swaps are needed.)
Average Case: O(n^2) (On average, it will have to make n^2/2 comparisons and n^2/2 swaps.)
Worst Case: O(n^2) (When the list is in reverse order or nearly sorted, it will have to make n^2 comparisons and n^2 swaps.)
