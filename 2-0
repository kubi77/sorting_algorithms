Best Case: O(n^2) (The number of comparisons and swaps will be the same as the average and worst cases.)
Average Case: O(n^2) (The number of comparisons and swaps is proportional to n^2, where n is the size of the array.)
Worst Case: O(n^2) (The number of comparisons and swaps is proportional to n^2, where n is the size of the array.)
